# 🔍 C Search Algorithms 📂

This repository contains simple C programs implementing two basic search algorithms — **Linear Search** and **Binary Search**. These are classic examples to understand how searching works in data structures.

## ✨ **What’s Included**

✅ `linear_search.c` — Search an element in an unsorted array using Linear Search.  
✅ `binary_search.c` — Search an element in a sorted array using Binary Search.

## 📌 **About the Algorithms**

### 🔹 Linear Search
- Checks every element one by one.
- Works on **unsorted arrays**.
- Simple but not very efficient for large data.

### 🔹 Binary Search
- Only works on **sorted arrays**.
- Repeatedly divides the search space in half.
- More efficient than Linear Search for large, sorted data.

## ⚙️ Compile the files

gcc linear_search.c -o linear_search

gcc binary_search.c -o binary_search

## ⚙️ Run the programs

./linear_search

./binary_search


## 💡 Learning Highlights
Understand basic searching techniques.

Work with arrays and loops in C.

Practice conditional statements.

Get familiar with input/output in C.

## 🎯 How to Improve
Add user input validation.

Make the programs work for strings.

Implement recursive Binary Search.

Add sorting and searching combined.
