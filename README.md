# C Search Algorithms
This repository contains simple implementations of **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** in C language.

## What’s Inside
- `linear_search.c` — Program to search an element using Linear Search.
- `binary_search.c` — Program to search an element using Binary Search (requires sorted array).

## Compile the C files:
gcc linear_search.c -o linear_search

gcc binary_search.c -o binary_search

## Run:
./linear_search

./binary_search

## About the Algorithms
Linear Search checks each element one by one. It works on unsorted data.
Binary Search repeatedly divides the search interval in half. The array must be sorted.

## Purpose
These programs are for practice and demonstration of basic search techniques in C.
